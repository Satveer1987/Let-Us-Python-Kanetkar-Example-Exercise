"""
a. Suppose there are three modules m1.py, m2.py, m3.py, containing functions f1(), f2(), and f3() respectively.
   How will you use those functions in your program?
   m1.f1()
   m2.f2()
   m3.f3()
b. Program provided separately.
c. Suppose a module mod.py contains functions f1(), f2(), and f3(). Write four forms of import statements to use
   these functions in your program.
    # version 1
    import mod

    # version 2
    from mode import *

    # version 3
    from mode import f1, f2, f3

    # version 4
    mod = __import__('mod')
