c. We can derive a class from a base class even if the base class's source code is not available.
d. Multiple inheritance is different from multiple levels of inheritance. - True
e. An object of a derived class cannot access members of base class is the member names begin with __. - True
f. Creating a derived class from a base class requires fundamental changes to the base class.
