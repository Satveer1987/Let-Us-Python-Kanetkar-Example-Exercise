"""
Suppose there is a base class B and a derived class D derived from B.
    B has two public member functions b1() and b2(), whereas D has two members functions d1() and d2().
    Write these classes for the following different situations:
    - b1() should be accessible from main module, b2() should not be.
    - Neither b1(), nor b2() should be accessible from main module.
    - Both b1() and b2() should be accessible from main module.
