Allow me to introduce myself—first negatively.

No landlord is my friend and brother, no chambermaid loves me, no waiter worships me, no boots admires and envies me.  No round of beef or tongue or ham is expressly cooked for me, no pigeon-pie is especially made for me, no hotel-advertisement is personally addressed to me, no hotel-room tapestried with great-coats and railway wrappers is set apart for me, no house of public entertainment in United Kingdom greatly cares for my opinion of its brandy or sherry.  When I go upon my journeys, I am not usually rated at low figure in bill; when I come home from my journeys, I never get any commission.  I know nothing about prices, and should have no idea, if I were put to it, how to wheedle man into ordering something he doesn’t want.  As town traveller, I am never to be seen driving vehicle externally like young and volatile pianoforte van, and internally like oven in which number of flat boxes are baking in layers.  As country traveller, I am rarely to be found in gig, and am never to be encountered by pleasure train, waiting on platform of branch station, quite Druid in midst of light Stonehenge of samples.

And yet—proceeding now, to introduce myself positively—I am both town traveller and country traveller, and am always on road.  Figuratively speaking, I travel for great house of Human Interest Brothers, and have rather large connection in fancy goods way.  Literally speaking, I am always wandering here and there from my rooms in Covent-garden, London—now about city streets: now, about country by-roads—seeing many little things, and some great things, which, because they interest me, I think may interest others.

These are my chief credentials as Uncommercial Traveller.
